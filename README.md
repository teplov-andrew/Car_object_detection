# Car_object_detection
### About my solution:
I tried to solve the problem of computer vision about the detection of cars. Decided as a training (for myself), so my solution may not be the most optimal and best, but you can use it as a baseline in some competition or a simple CV pipeline.

### Data:
I got data from this [competition](https://ods.ai/competitions/mcs_car_verification).

### Model:
I fine tuning a `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn` about 5 epoch and I got not bad resault:

You can try it yourself with the `show_img_car_detection.ipynb` file.
